# Informations
Az_train is a complete train management script on FiveM, it allows you to have train garages, container inventories synchronized between all players and train robberies. All of this totally open source. 

## DLC
Old DLC (include Subway and Train event) was move into the main ressource, for use it, just enable it in the configuration in the config.lua.

## Robberies
The robberies are a point that makes the originality of the script, it will allow you to make your commercial crossroads dangerous if people decide to steal an important cargo, the associated commands to make the robberies are marked below. The bombs allowing to stop the train also allow to bring an important point for your server which is the demining of this one, create a branch LSPD or BSCO which will be able to deminer the bombs (finally a script which allows you to use the [EOD of London script](https://forum.cfx.re/t/bomb-disposal-robot-eod-remote-control-controlled-explosion-water-jet-night-vision-paid-resource/1798119)).
